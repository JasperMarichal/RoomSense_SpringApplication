                                    During our school career we worked on various projects,
                                    RoomSense was our biggest project. We are committed to create a device that
                                    can help us optimise the usage of classrooms and offices alike.
                                    We have the luck to have two powerful shapers in our team.
                                    The idea came into their heads and together
                                    with the fantastic implementers we implemented the idea into a real product.
