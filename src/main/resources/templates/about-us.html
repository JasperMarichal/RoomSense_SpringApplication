        <p class="card-text">We are a team of five ambitious students.
            All passionate about new technologies to improve our environment.
            During our school career we worked on various projects,
            RoomSense was our biggest project. We are committed to create a device that
            can help us optimise the usage of classrooms and offices alike.
            We have the luck to have two powerful shapers in our team.
            The idea came into their heads and together
            with the fantastic implementers we implemented the idea into a real product.</p>    </div>
